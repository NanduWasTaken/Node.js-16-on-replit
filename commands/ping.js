   * This will not teach you how to program nor teach you how to use the discord.js library.
   * There are plenty of guides, all this is for is for organizing your events, commands, and settings neatly.
   * 
   * To make more commands just add files like commandname.js; the name of the file is the command being ran.
   * Inside of these you can interact with arguments ("args"), don't make seperate files per argument.
   * 
   * Now you can bot til your hearts content!!
